First create the package.json file with command ---> npm init
To run the node file, we have to write ---> node fileName

Gloabl Object---- window, global
    In Browser we have window is global Object. The window object is given by Browser not by the V8 Engine.
    But in node we have global as a global object. Global is given by Node.js not by V8 Engine.
   
    Behaviour of this : 
    CommonJS: Top-level this is {} (an alias for module.exports). type: "CommonJS"
    ESM: Top-level this is undefined. type: "module"
    How to Fix or Adjust Behavior
    If you want to log this as {} instead of undefined:

    Ensure you're using CommonJS modules:

    Rename your file to .cjs.
    Or, ensure "type": "commonjs" is set in your package.json.
    If you're using ESM (or "type": "module"), this will be undefined by design.

NOTE: In Browser ---> window, this, self, frames --> returns window object
        There are different global object in browser and node 
        so the OpenJS foundation decided to make single gloabl object so that every broswer and node
        can use the global object. 
        And the name of the global object is --> globalThis
